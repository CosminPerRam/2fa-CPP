# 2FA - CPP
This is a repository for a very bare-bones 2fa (2 factor authenticator) integration made in C++. The original version of the code is made by [Arne Gockeln](https://github.com/ArneGockeln), this one is a version made for straight and easy integration and use.

# Use
With all the required files, in you main operational file, you have to include the `Auth.h` file. 
A token is generated by the `generateToken()` function which is called as `auth::generateToken()` requires the 2fa secret to generate the token and the optional, not suggested to edit, timeout interval.

You can test the program by adding the exact same hash secret on pretty much any 2fa apps on your phone.

# Compile
The code is based on a modified version of [libcppotp](https://github.com/tilkinsc/COTP) (COPT) library and it is required for the code to run successfully.

If you are not sure how to use the code, check the `example.cpp` file.
